# StyleGAN2 Based Image Generation Network on ANDI Brain Dataset
## Project Aim
The aim of the model is to create a Image generation network of the ANDI dataset based on StyleGAN2.

## GAN, StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 architecture

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has two main components: a generator and a discriminator.

The two components play a min-max game. In one short sentence, generator generates fake images, while the discriminator 
trys to classify if its input is real or fake.


The generator generates learn to generate fake images by incorporating back propagated data from the discriminator. It 
requires a random noise as input, and


The discriminator is a classification network. It takes images as input and tries to distinguish fake data generated by 
the generator from the real data. 

### StyleGAN

While GAN can give reasonably clear images, it lacks control of the style of the synthetic images. StyleGAN is a 
generative model based on the GAN. It is capable of generating more realistic images, and offers control over the style
of the generated image at different levels of detail. (Jason Brownlee, 2020). 

StyleGAN2 is based on the baseline progressive GAN architecture, but a few major changes were made:
- USe of Bi-linear Sampling instead of nearly neighbour used in baseline progressive grow GANs
- Instead of a traditional latent input, generator takes a learned constant. 
- Using a standalone mapping network and AdaIN for style transfer.
  - The mapping network is a neural network composed of 8 fully connected layers. It takes a randomly sampled point from
  the latent space and generates a style vector. The style vector is then transformed and incorporated to each block of
  generator via adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN). 
- Addition of noise to each layer.
  - The noise is used to generate style-level variation.
- Mixing regularization
  - Since the Style generation uses intermediate vector at each level of synthesis, the network may learn the 
  correlation between the levels. Mixing regularization is introduced to reduce the correlation between levels.
